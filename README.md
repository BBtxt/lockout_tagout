## General Info 
Proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practices and procedures safeguard workers from hazardous energy releases. To protect workers and equipment a steps must be followed to preform a lock out tag out on a set peice of equipment. This web applcation will be enhancing the second step of the LOTO process, Notifying all parties involved. All partys are able to see what equipment is Locked out and who orders the lock out, yet only the person who made the lock out can delete the post.
### Lock out tag out procedure
1. Locate the procedure that is required for the machine you are going to be working on. This procedure should identify the specific piece of equipment you are working on along with a step by step process for shutting down and restarting the equipment.
2. Notify anyone affected by the lockout tagout.
Before any work on the equipment can be performed, all co-workers, contractors, or additional parties that may be affected must be notified. Share when you will begin working and how long the equipment may be unavailable. If there needs to be any changes to work processes, make sure they are aware of these changes.
3. Locate all listed energy sources.
The lockout tagout procedure you are using should list all energy sources that need isolated. It may even provide pictures showing the exact location of the hazardous energy. Energy sources include things like electricity, hydraulics, chemicals, and others that all have the potential or seriously injure or kill someone if not properly isolated.
4. Shut down the machine or equipment.
The steps to do so should be listed in the lockout tagout procedure and should detail the exact actions needed to shut down the equipment. Some machines or equipment require multiple steps to shut down, all these steps must be followed exactly as they are listed.
5. Lockout and tag all energy isolating devices.
Use the locks and tags assigned to you, no one else should remove these except a direct supervisor in extreme circumstances. Generally, this requires approval.
If more than one person is involved in maintaining or servicing the machine or equipment each individual must attach their own lock or tag to the energy isolating device.
6. Release any stored energy (steam, hydraulic, etc.).
Make sure the area is clear before releasing any stored energy, and take into consideration hazards such as moving equipment that should be secured before working.
7. Operate controls to test disconnects. The machine or equipment should not operate.
Once all energy sources have been disconnected and locked out or tagged, attempt to start the equipment. This verifies that the equipment has been successfully locked out. Once again make sure the area is clear before testing the controls. All controls should be rendered useless if the procedure has been successful.
8. Return controls to off position.
Return the controls to the off position so the machine won't start when any energy sources are reconnected. You can now work on the machine or equipment!
